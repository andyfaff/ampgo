|infinity| Global Optimization Benchmarks and **AMPGO**
=======================================================

**AMPGO** stands for `Adaptive Memory Programming for Global Optimization`, an algorithm I 
found on the web and I implemented in Python.

A generic and basic description of the algorithm, together with a number of sensitivities on
the input parameters for the Python function, are described in the dedicated :ref:`AMPGO` page.


|introduction| Introduction
---------------------------

These HTML pages contain a series of benchmarks to test a number of numerical Global 
Optimization algorithms; the algorithms are applied to multi-modal/difficult 
univariate and multi-dimensional test functions.


|motivation| Motivation
-----------------------

This effort stems from the fact that I got fed up with the current attitude of most
mathematicians/numerical optimization experts, who tend to demonstrate the advantages of
an algorithm based on "elapsed time" or "CPU time" or similar meaningless performance
indicators.

I deal with real-life optimization problems, as most of us do.

Most real life optimization problems require intensive and time consuming simulations 
for every **function evaluation**; the time spent by the solver itself doing its 
calculations simply disappears in front of the real process simulation. I know it because 
our simulations take between 2 and 48 hours to run, so what's 300 seconds more or less in
the solver calculations?

.. _the rules:

|rules| The Rules
-----------------

In order to be eligible for the competition, a Global Optimization algorithm **must** satisfy 
the following constraints:

1. It should run on my PCs, equipped with Windows 7 64 bit and Python 2.7 64 bit. This means
   that the algorithm should be coded in pure Python, or the developer should provide a
   Windows installer, or it should be of easy compilation using standard Python tools plus
   Visual Studio, Intel Fortran and `f2py <http://www.scipy.org/F2py>`_.

   See :ref:`The Great Excluded` section for a few examples of algorithms written by people
   living in their dream world.
   
2. No gradient-based procedures allowed: the problems I deal with in real life are so
   horrendously complex that you can't even mention the word "gradient". 
   Derivative-free algorithms only. 
   
3. No unconstrained optimization routines allowed: I mostly care about box-bounded problems,
   so the algorithm should support bounds on independent variables as a minimum condition
   for eligibility.


The test suite is executed in the following manner:

1. Every optimization algorithm is fed with all the test functions, using 100 different random
   starting points. For any test function, the starting point is the same for all the
   algorithms.
   
   Benchmark repeatability is enforced through the use of the same random seed every time the
   test suite is run.
   
2. No tuning of parameters is allowed: all the algorithms have been run with their default
   settings, irrespective of the dimensionality of the problem, the starting point or any 
   other consideration.
   
3. The maximum number of function evaluations is set to **2,000**, irrespective of the algorithm,
   the dimensionality of the problem, the starting point or any other consideration. 
   This is non-negotiable.
   
   If this limit is exceeded, the test is considered as "failed". Otherwise the number of function
   evaluations reported by the algorithm is recorded for later statistical analysis.
   
4. All the test functions have known global optimum values: I considered an algorithm to be
   successful if:
   
   .. math::
   
      \lvert F_{known \hspace{3pt} minimum} - F_{algorithm \hspace{3pt} minimum} \rvert \leq 10^{-6}
   
   
   While still respecting the condition at point (2).


|test_functions| Test Functions
-------------------------------

All the test functions have been taken from the mathematical literature on Global Optimization.
The test suite currently contains:

1. 18 one-dimensional test functions with multiple local/global minima;
2. 184 multivariate problems (where the number of independent variables ranges from 2 to 17),
   again with multiple local/global minima.

The index of the test function is in :ref:`Test Functions Index` page: as the list is quite large,
their definition has been split into multiple pages using the first letter of their name. 
Whenever possible, a 2D or 3D plot of the test function has been provided.


.. note::

   If you wish to contribute to the test suite (i.e., to add a new benchmark problem), please 
   do send me an email to andrea.gavana@gmail.com, I'll integrate your contribution with due
   credits and I will re-run the algorithms comparison.
   

.. _the great excluded:

|excluded| The Great Excluded
-----------------------------

This section presents a (possibly incomplete) list of algorithms/libraries that have been 
excluded from the benchmark competition, as they do not comply with one or more of the rules
spelled out in :ref:`The Rules` section.

1. **ALGENCAN**: praised by many for its robustness and convergence qualities, you can get a 
   copy of the source code from here:
   
   http://www.ime.usp.br/~egbirgin/tango/codes.php
   
   Unfortunately, no Windows installer is available and the code is not easily compilable on Windows.
   
   Fail.

2. **PyGMO**: based on the C++ code of PaGMO, it contains a lot of different optimizers and seems
   very promising:

   http://pagmo.sourceforge.net/pygmo/index.html
   
   Unfortunately, the Windows version is 32 bit-only, and compilation seems to be a 
   `very problematic matter <http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=28542939>`_.
   
   Fail.
   

|algorithms| Tested Algorithms

   I have added a few improvements here and there based on my Master Thesis work on the standard
   Tunnelling Algorithm of Levy, Montalvo and Gomez. A generic and basic description of the algorithm, 
   together with a number of sensitivities on the input parameters for the Python function, are 
   described in the dedicated :ref:`AMPGO` page.
